# Algorithm-Programming-2

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed for **learning and testing purposes** in the **Algorithm Programming 2** course.

## Description
- ✅ **Create** — Add new data entries  
- 📄 **Read** — Display stored data  
- 📝 **Update** — Modify existing data  
- ❌ **Delete** — Remove data entries

## 🎯 Purpose
This CRUD project helps reinforce core topics in algorithmic logic and data handling, including:
- Practice basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Understand how data is managed in memory (e.g., using lists or arrays)
- Implement event-driven programming (if using Windows Forms)
- Strengthen logic using conditional statements and loops
- Gain familiarity with the structure of a C# project using Visual Studio
- Handle user input and simple validation within a UI or console
